# PledgePath (Hackathon Project)

## Introduction

PledgePath is a groundbreaking application aimed at fostering self-discipline and personal growth. It revolutionizes the way individuals commit to their goals by incorporating a unique pledge system. Users pledge on themselves, attaching a small monetary amount to their commitment, such as going to the gym regularly. When they fulfill their pledge, the app utilizes geolocation technology to verify their attendance at the designated location.

One of the standout features of PledgePath is its incentive mechanism. Upon successful completion of a pledge, users receive their pledged amount back, reinforcing positive behavior and providing a tangible reward for their efforts. This innovative approach not only encourages consistency but also fosters a sense of achievement and satisfaction.

PledgePath empowers individuals to take control of their goals and transform aspirations into reality. By combining financial commitment, accountability, and rewards, PledgePath is a powerful tool for personal growth and success.

## Getting Started

### Server Side

1. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the server on port 5001:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

### Client Side

1. Navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the client on port 3000:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

Once the server and client are running, users can access the application through their web browser. The application facilitates efficient communication and problem-solving by encouraging users to articulate both their proposed solution and the underlying problem they aim to address. This approach helps prevent the common pitfalls associated with the "A/B problem" and promotes more effective collaboration within software development teams.
